# My SQL Projects Portfolio 

Greetings and thank you for stopping by! 
This repository contains examples of SQL code that I have developed for various solo projects and while studying data analytics, machine learning, and other related courses. Feel free to explore the different folders and highlighted projects to get a sense of my work.
